# ChatApp - FrontEnd

## NOTES
### When using the webapp
I'm sorry, the code is not well documentated :(.
#### Home
The entries on top of the divider are the chats with other users.

The other entries are the group chats.

The icon on the right indicates the current status of the chat. One tick means you sent a request to write, two ticks mean that you can chat, a callsign indicates that you received a request to chat.

#### Group chat
When a member is written in an italic font-style, then the member has not accepted the request to join the group.

## Installation
Install [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/).

For Windows only: add the Angular CLI to the PATH enviroment variable.

Run `npm install` in the main directory. 

## Open development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
